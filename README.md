# Telegram-Reminder-Bot
This is my second project created with Python using the aiogram library (version 2.25.1).  
The idea of this bot is simple: when you run the /start command, it sends you a welcome message.  
Then, by typing: /remind *Time* *What needs to be done*,  
you can set a daily reminder with the specified text at the chosen time.
